## **Acknowledgments**
We extend our gratitude to **Prof. Luyao Zhang** for valuable guidance throughout this research, as well as classmates for their feedback and discussions. We also acknowledge the contributions of **AI-assisted tools (e.g., ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, Hugging Face models)** and **open-source libraries** such as `scikit-learn`, `XGBoost`, `matplotlib`, and `pandas`, which facilitated the execution of this project.

## **Statement of Intellectual and Professional Growth**
This project has deepened my understanding of **machine learning applications in social science**, particularly in **transportation modeling**. Through building predictive models for congestion forecasting, I have strengthened my skills in **data preprocessing, supervised learning, feature engineering, and model evaluation**. The experience also honed my ability to translate **machine learning insights into policy-relevant recommendations**, a crucial skill for data-driven decision-making in real-world applications.
