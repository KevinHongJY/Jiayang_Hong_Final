# Data Folder Overview

This folder holds datasets from **Nature Researchâ€™s Scientific Data**. The primary files are hosted on Zenodo. You can access them here:[**Zenodo Record #4541153**](https://zenodo.org/records/4541153)
), which follows the General Modeling Network Specification (GMNS) format for node-link representations (`node.csv`, `link.csv`), supplemented by origin-destination (OD) matrices that capture time-dependent travel flows. By combining static structural attributes (nodes and links) with dynamic traffic flow data (OD matrices), researchers can analyze network congestion, test adaptive signal controls, and assess equity impacts. This multi-source approach enriches the overall model, providing a more nuanced view of urban transportation patterns and enabling scenario analyses across different times of day and various demand conditions.
