Explanation for NLP Results:

This section provides an analysis of sentiment trends and topic modeling applied to transportation policy texts. Two key visualizations summarize the insights derived from Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

Sentiment Score Distribution
The first visualization represents the distribution of sentiment scores across transportation-related policy documents. Sentiment analysis was performed using the VADER Sentiment Analyzer, which assigns a score to each document ranging from -1 (very negative) to +1 (very positive).

The x-axis shows the sentiment scores, where negative values indicate critical feedback (e.g., complaints about congestion, toll increases), while positive values indicate supportive feedback (e.g., improvements in bike lanes).
The mean sentiment score is marked with a red dashed line, suggesting that the overall tone of transportation policies is neutral to slightly positive.
The distribution shows polarity, meaning that different policies evoke strong reactions, either positive or negative.
Topic Importance in Transport Policy Texts
The second visualization represents the distribution of major topics extracted using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).

The x-axis represents two dominant topics identified from the dataset.
The y-axis represents the importance (or weight) of each topic in shaping public discussion around transportation.
Topic 1 is more dominant, indicating that a specific concern (e.g., congestion reduction or toll policies) appears frequently in policy discussions.
Topic 2 captures a secondary theme, potentially related to public transit expansion or accessibility improvements.
